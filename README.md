# Steam Time Idler
You know idle master? You know people who spam reviews? This is the idlemaster for review spammers. #iloveinternetpoints

Well you set up a time (5 mins for reviews) and it checks your games and picks the ones you have less than that time, and uses steamapi to emulate those games, 20 at a time.

Also you need to have a public profile, so it can get your game list.
